# mARK.it - The Ultimate Bookmark Manager

## Project Description
mARK.it is a **hybrid bookmark management system** that helps users **capture**, **organize**, and **synchronize** bookmarks from various platforms into a single, centralized interface. With a browser extension for easy bookmarking and a web app for advanced organization, Mark.it ensures that users never lose track of important links. With mARK.it, your bookmarks aren’t just saved—they’re seamlessly connected, intelligently organized, and instantly accessible, anytime, anywhere.

## Problem Statement
Managing bookmarks across multiple platforms is a **chaotic** and **fragmented experience**:
- Browser bookmarks are **limited to a single device** unless synced manually.
- Social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit) **do not offer an easy way to export saved links**.
- Users end up **losing track of saved links** due to disorganization.
- Manually importing/exporting bookmarks is tedious.

mARK.it solves this problem by providing a **seamless browser extension** for capturing bookmarks and a **web app** for managing, organizing, and searching saved links.
